# simpanel
Flight Simulator autopilot and general switch panel (intended, at the moment, for FS2020 but would likely work with most/all other flight simulators)


_You almost certainly do not want to try using this yet!_

This is very much work-in-progress; it kinda-sorta works...ish in debug mode with lots of hacks and manual operations, and there isn't even a proper build process for the firmware yet (it still has to be manually built and burned to the MCUs)

The hardware is in a decent state, and relies on an Ardunio Mega 2560 for logic.  Included are the CADs for the PCBoard and casing.  Do note there isn't a proper BOM for assembly right now.

If you really like the idea and want to fiddle with it, you almost certainly want to drop me an email for help and guidance for now.
